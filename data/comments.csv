1623384493.0,h1d673f,nwmg23,"Ok lad i'll learn you some rights of citizenship 101. Let's say Sam is an American citizen, so American actually that his ancestor was on the boat with General Washington on the Delaware. Now Sam is a resident of the state of new york. He has just finished college and has been offered a well paying position in ohio. He rents a studio apartment, which is his primary residence, does the moving stuff and settles in. Now what is he? A resident of Ohio. Can he vote in elections for state house and governor and mayor of his city and stuff? Yes! Is he counted as a resident in the state census? yes!That's how citizenship works. If a state is part of the union, then a citizen of that union has the right to travel through that state and settle in that state as long as he can afford to have a residence in that state. That is basic common sense. If the tax rupees of hard working people in mumbai, chennai, kolkata, lucknow, varanasi, bangalore, hyderabad and such places is going to subsidise kashmir then people from these places can settle there to pursue opportunities, or they like the scenery and buy a house, or whatever their reason be. And they should be able to exercise their democratic right to elect a MP to national parliament, MLA to state parliament and councilmen and such.In fact the law that prohibited people from other states from settling in Kashmir is discriminatory. It was intended to keep an ""official"" Muslim majority in the state and deny any representation to other citizens of the union. Btw you do realise if your mum is Kashmiri you can't be a resident of Kashmir? it has to be your dad.;Before you start spouting some bs political slogans do educate yourself on the reality and history of the situation. Read up on the Exodus on Kashmiri Pandits while you are at it. it will tell you something about the people who made that discriminatory law.;Edit: typo",1

Willing to work hard for what she wants, and doesn't blame things that go wrong in her life on men in general.You're right, there are a lot of feminists. Not as many as there are decent women out there though. It really isn't hard to find good people, you just listen for phrases like mansplaining and fragile masculinity And go the other direction when you hear them.I don't think I said anything about being a victim. That's all this gal that is claiming she's a victim. I just pointed out a flaw in this other poster's logic. That doesn't make me a victim, that makes that other person a fucking dimwit. I don't have a victim complex. I am not a victim. Someone said something that I disagree with, and instead of claiming harassment, I just called bullshit. You should give it a try sometime, that's the reasonable way to handle things you disagree with.I'm sorry that you had some shitty mail coworkers. I'm even sorry or you seem to have generalized that to men in general. That's kind of like saying you had a bad experience with a Mexican person once, so Mexicans are awful people.Fragile masculinity is not a thing. It is human nature to defend one's opinions, and positions.

North Brother Island was once the site of the Riverside Hospital for quarantinable diseases but is now uninhabited. The islands had long been privately owned, but were purchased by the federal government in 2007 with some funding from The Trust for Public Land and others; both were given to the City.

Because she persisted in working as a cook, by which she exposed others to the disease, she was twice forcibly quarantined by authorities, eventually for the final two decades of her life.

I'm just looking for consistency from your arguments here. At the very least, think of it this way: I think for ethical purposes, it's actually worth approaching the US prison system as a system of concentration camps, and whether or not you agree with the dictionary definition, it's equally valid to approach the facilities in both the US and in China with the same frame of mind.

A man has an extremely small risk of contracting HIV when engaging in PIV intercourse, regardless.

The only way to make that number 0 is to wear a condom. There's also the false sense of security that this can provide, meaning you are more likely to engage in risky sex if you think you're immune to HIV. It's worth noting that no respected medical organization in the world recommends circumcision as a preventative procedure.

It's worth noting, the law derives from an Islamic view that a male partner (spouse) or close relative (i.e. brother or father) *should* live with a woman. The reasoning is for physical protection. Obviously Islam and Saudi Arabia illegalize things like rape, murder, robbery etc as well, obviously that alone is not always enough. The idea here is having a physically stronger person living with you would offer some more protection from those sorts of things. Obviously nothing stops anything 100%, but that's the purpose. I'm a small girl, I appreciate this sort of thing. As much as I see myself as a strong independent person, I am physically aware of myself. Obviously not every female wants this sort of thing and should be able to opt-out.**In fact the Shariah does not require a woman to live with a relative or spouse, but recommends it** (even the most conservative Hanbali madhab holds this opinion, as does Shafi), for this reason I'm not sure why Saudi had this requirement in place so long, it's not an Islamic requirement but recommendation.

It just gets rid of unnecessary red tape and allows companies to manufacture the vaccines (but not sell them) while clinical trials are still going on. Emergency use authorization is proper approval. In any case, they’ve both applied for regular approval, so that talking point will hopefully go away.This explains it: https://vaccine.unchealthcare.org/science/vaccine-approval/whats-the-difference-between-fda-emergency-use-authorization-and-fda-approval/“The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released the first three COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use and others are expected to follow. Some consumers may have questions about what Emergency Use Authorization means, and how it differs from normal vaccine approval.In a public health emergency, manufacturing and approval of vaccines can be streamlined through an Emergency Use Authorization or EUA. An EUA does not affect vaccine safety, because it does not impact development, such as research, clinical studies and the studying of side effects and adverse reactions. Instead, it speeds up manufacturing and administrative processes.All vaccines follow the same testing processes, whether they are approved for emergency use or through a typical license.Clinical trials are conducted in three phases.In Phase 1, the vaccine is given to a small number of generally healthy people to assess its safety and effectiveness.In Phase 2, the vaccine is given to hundreds of people with different health conditions and from diverse demographic groups.In Phase 3, the vaccine is administered to thousands of people across demographic groups and immune responses are compared against placebos, which are doses that don’t contain any of the vaccine and are used for testing purposes only.Once Phase 3 trials are complete, the FDA reviews the data to determine whether the vaccine works and is safe. If so, the manufacturer files for approval.This is where the process may change due to a public health emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.Usually, the manufacturer would apply for a Biologics License Application (BLA). If the FDA determines that the vaccine is safe, works and that manufacturing can be done safely and consistently, it will grant a license for the vaccine.In a public health emergency, manufacturing may occur while vaccines are still in development, rather than after approval. These efforts happen simultaneously, and instead of filing for a BLA, the manufacturer files for Emergency Use Authorization.If the benefits outweigh any possible risks of the vaccine and manufacturing quality can be ensured, the FDA will approve the vaccine for emergency use.Emergency use authorizations are an important part in addressing public health emergencies and ending the COVID-19 pandemic.”",1

1623381692.0,h1d19yq,nwvuoe,"OP is not very accurate with his description.So the ""national ID"" he talks about is actually just an authentication tool. How this works is: you get a national ID number, have your biometrics attached to it when you get it. And there is a central authentication system that acts like a password checking system.Every store has a ID verification system setup, like the credit card reader in the US. When you go to get a new SIM card, you tell them your aadhar number, and put your fingerprint on the ID verification device, the fingerprint and the number is sent to the authentication service which says ""match"" or  ""not a match"". If it is a match, then you are authenticated and can do whatever you wanted to do like getting a sim card/renew passport/get driver's license/open a bank account etc. So technically, the national ID is just a way to authenticate you. It is not ""tied"" to your sim card or anything.Think of national ID as your username and your fingerprint as your password. All the central service is doing is saying whether id and fingerprints match. Its just that your password is your fingerprint that nobody can copy. And you also get an authentication message for two-factor authentication. So overall, a pretty solid and safe way to identify and authenticate 1.3 billion people in a country that does not have good national identification documentation. So that ID by itself is pretty useless as you need biometrics with it to authenticate. And this ID is not related to anything financial either, so it is not like SSN.",1
