# WCD_DE_Project
Mid Term pipeline for WCD DE

Figuring out what to do.

To Do List:
1. Figure out how to pull all posts/comments from a given subreddit; not sure if i want to actually pull all the comments as well though
2. Iron out above into a useable format (probably csv?)
3. Dump it into either an S3 bucket or a GCP bucket cause reasons
